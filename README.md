# A Game (again)

Hello. We are all blessed on this day.

Hello. We are all blessed

Thoughts

- Capybara themed
- Enemies are capybara predators
  - anacondoodads
  - panthers
  - ocelots
  - eagles
- oranges are used as throwing weapons after you collect them
  - minigame where you try to balance oranges on your head
- maybe you can jump on enemy heads
- Alternate game: platforms scroll up from the bottom of the screen and you have to find a way down before you hit the top of the screen

To do:

- Add mobile support (clickable controls at bottom)
